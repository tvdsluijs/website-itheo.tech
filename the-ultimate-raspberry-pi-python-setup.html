I like a clean desk policy, so I do not have a lot of distraction.</p><p>Does it always is this clean.... well .... <strong>NO!</strong> I usualy work at my desk and if work is done things get ugly (or dirty). However I always try to start with a clean desk (or end by cleaning my desk for the next morning).</p><p>So that is it! The Ultimate Raspberry Pi and Python setup! Nothing to see no distractions. I have it working, but not on my Desk!</p><p>Okay... that was a small inside joke! When I set things up it usually is on my desk. But when ready I put it in my 10Inch server rack.</p><p>So let's start with the Ultimate Raspberry Pi Python setup!</p><h2 id="heading-raspberry-pi-and-python">Raspberry Pi and Python</h2><p>The Raspberry Pi is a great tool for learning about computers and programming. With Python, you can start building your own programs without having to learn a complicated programming language. Python is a popular language for beginners because it is easy to read and write. A Raspberry Pi running python gives you access to the internet and can be used as a web server.</p><p>Python includes many built-in libraries that make it easier to perform different tasks, such as manipulating images or processing text files. One of the most popular libraries, called NumPy, makes it possible to do complex numerical work like managing matrices and arrays of numbers with ease.</p><p>This article aims to provide you with a step-by-step process on how to install Python on your Raspberry Pi.</p><h2 id="heading-raspberry-pi-os">Raspberry Pi OS</h2><p>If you already have an OS installed on your Raspberry Pi just skip this section and go to the Installing Python on Raspberry Pi part.</p><p>There are a few ways you can install Raspberry Pi OS.</p><h3 id="heading-install-raspberry-pi-os-using-raspberry-pi-imager">Install Raspberry Pi OS using Raspberry Pi Imager</h3><p>Raspberry Pi Imager is the easiest and most quickest way to install Raspberry Pi OS and other operating systems to a microSD card, ready to use with your Raspberry Pi.</p><p>Just follow the tutorial in this YouTube video.</p><p></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ntaXWS8Lk34?feature=oembed"></iframe></div><p>Download and install Raspberry Pi Imager to a computer with an SD card reader.

As said I do not like a cluttered desk to work on, or start working on. I used to have multiple Raspberry Pi's on my Desk but with the (almost) silent fan's blowing and the place it took, I wanted to get rid of them.</p><p>So when moving into my current house I've spend a lot of thought and money on how my network and all the devices should look like and put away. In the Netherlands the fuse boxes, or should I say Fuse cabinets are small. You can not really put a 19inch rack in it. But a 10Inch ifts fine!</p><p>So I've bought the biggest 10 inch I could find. I've let a guy on etsy 3d print a raspberry pi 1u holder. I placed POE Hat's for my rasp's and placed everything inside the 10inch rack.</p><p>It looks like this!</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://itheo.tech/media/posts/80/93NrylxGJ.jpeg" alt sizes="100vw" srcset="https://itheo.tech/media/posts/80/responsive/93NrylxGJ-xs.webp 300w, https://itheo.tech/media/posts/80/responsive/93NrylxGJ-sm.webp 480w, https://itheo.tech/media/posts/80/responsive/93NrylxGJ-md.webp 768w, https://itheo.tech/media/posts/80/responsive/93NrylxGJ-lg.webp 1024w, https://itheo.tech/media/posts/80/responsive/93NrylxGJ-xl.webp 1360w, https://itheo.tech/media/posts/80/responsive/93NrylxGJ-2xl.webp 1600w"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://itheo.tech/media/posts/80/wV8bwJ7bN.jpeg" alt sizes="100vw" srcset="https://itheo.tech/media/posts/80/responsive/wV8bwJ7bN-xs.webp 300w, https://itheo.tech/media/posts/80/responsive/wV8bwJ7bN-sm.webp 480w, https://itheo.tech/media/posts/80/responsive/wV8bwJ7bN-md.webp 768w, https://itheo.tech/media/posts/80/responsive/wV8bwJ7bN-lg.webp 1024w, https://itheo.tech/media/posts/80/responsive/wV8bwJ7bN-xl.webp 1360w, https://itheo.tech/media/posts/80/responsive/wV8bwJ7bN-2xl.webp 1600w"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://itheo.tech/media/posts/80/YRzvVpZfB.jpeg" alt sizes="100vw" srcset="https://itheo.tech/media/posts/80/responsive/YRzvVpZfB-xs.webp 300w, https://itheo.tech/media/posts/80/responsive/YRzvVpZfB-sm.webp 480w, https://itheo.tech/media/posts/80/responsive/YRzvVpZfB-md.webp 768w, https://itheo.tech/media/posts/80/responsive/YRzvVpZfB-lg.webp 1024w, https://itheo.tech/media/posts/80/responsive/YRzvVpZfB-xl.webp 1360w, https://itheo.tech/media/posts/80/responsive/YRzvVpZfB-2xl.webp 1600w"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://itheo.tech/media/posts/80/s_GzdUvKG.jpeg" alt sizes="100vw" srcset="https://itheo.tech/media/posts/80/responsive/s_GzdUvKG-xs.webp 300w, https://itheo.tech/media/posts/80/responsive/s_GzdUvKG-sm.webp 480w, https://itheo.tech/media/posts/80/responsive/s_GzdUvKG-md.webp 768w, https://itheo.tech/media/posts/80/responsive/s_GzdUvKG-lg.webp 1024w, https://itheo.tech/media/posts/80/responsive/s_GzdUvKG-xl.webp 1360w, https://itheo.tech/media/posts/80/responsive/s_GzdUvKG-2xl.webp 1600w"></p><p>Great setup for Raspberry Pi & Python</p><p>So what do you need? <em>(affiliate links ahead!)</em></p><ol><li><a target="_blank" href="https://aff.itheo.tech/out/10-inch-rack" rel="noopener">10inch rack</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://aff.itheo.tech/out/poe-hat-4" rel="noopener">Raspberry Pi POE HAT (v4)</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://aff.itheo.tech/out/Raspberry-10-inch-rack-mount-1U" rel="noopener">Raspberry Pi 10Inch rack mount 1u</a></li></ol><p>That's it!
